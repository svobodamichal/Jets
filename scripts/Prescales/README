Perday files contain cummulative number of events. Subtraction is done by process_runs.sh.

merge_files.sh merges two files for each trigger and keeps only the info important for the analysis (Run_Number, Number_of_Events, Sampled_Luminosity, Prescale, and Livetime) and also orders the lines before merging, according to the start time

remove_bad_runs.sh removes the lines which contain run number from bad run list

find_missing.sh checks if there are some run numbers in either of the triggers whuch are not in the other cleaned file
